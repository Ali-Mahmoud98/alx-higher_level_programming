# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

## 0. Read file
**Files:** [0-read_file.py](0-read_file.py)
Write a function that reads a text file (`UTF8`) and prints it to stdout:

* Prototype: `def read_file(filename=""):`
* You must use the `with` statement
* You don’t need to manage `file permission` or `file doesn't exist` exceptions.
* You are not allowed to import any module
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat 0-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
read_file = __import__('0-read_file').read_file

read_file("my_file_0.txt")

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat my_file_0.txt

## 1. Write to a file
**Files:** [1-write_file.py](1-write_file.py)
Write a function that writes a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written:

* Prototype: `def write_file(filename="", text=""):`
* You must use the `with` statement
* You don’t need to manage file permission exceptions.
* Your function should create the file if doesn’t exist.
* Your function should overwrite the content of the file if it already exists.
* You are not allowed to import any module
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat 1-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
write_file = __import__('1-write_file').write_file

nb_characters = write_file("my_first_file.txt", "This School is so cool!\n")
print(nb_characters)

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ ./1-main.py
29
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat my_first_file.txt
This School is so cool!
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ 
```
## 2. Append to a file
**Files:** [2-append_write.py](2-append_write.py)
Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters added:

* Prototype: `def append_write(filename="", text=""):`
* If the file doesn’t exist, it should be created
* You must use the `with` statement
* You don’t need to manage `file permission` or `file doesn't exist` exceptions.
* You are not allowed to import any module
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat 2-main.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
append_write = __import__('2-append_write').append_write

nb_characters_added = append_write("file_append.txt", "This School is so cool!\n")
print(nb_characters_added)

guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat file_append.txt
cat: file_append.txt: No such file or directory
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ ./2-main.py
29
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat file_append.txt
This School is so cool!
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ ./2-main.py
29
guillaume@ubuntu:~/0x0B$ cat file_append.txt
This School is so cool!
This School is so cool!
